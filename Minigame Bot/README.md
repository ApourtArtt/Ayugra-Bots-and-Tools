# Ayugra Minigame Bot

Before using it, be aware that it is risky to use. Even with custom values.
Don't forget that NosTale staff is checking minigame players frequently.
Also, don't use it while doing anything else, I guess NosTale staff is checking that too.
If you still want to use it, read further.

# How does it work

Firstly, Open the Minigame Bot as admin, it is required since NosTale is also started as admin.
Set your Ayugra ID in the bot.
Change the value to be human-like. Don't set your timers to 10s for a Lv.5 Box on fishing, you'll get banned easily.
In clear : configure the bot as you want, BUT keep in mind that if it's not doable by a human, you'll get banned.
Once configured, click on Start.
Then go back to NosTale, open the minigame you want to play, and wait. Don't do anything else, just click Open.

Ayugra is bypassing their "1 minute inactivity", so don't be scared from this.
The only thing you have to be scared about, is the configuration : do some game, find your own timers and use them.
